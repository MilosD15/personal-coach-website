                    <h1>Meet me</h1>
                    <p>Hi, there! I'm Dark Wendy professional personal coach and fitness trainer with over 5 years of experience and over 40 people I helped to become what they deserve. When I was a child, my dream was to become an actor. I have gone to the local theatre for 4 years but without so much success. After that failure, I decided to try something completely new. Since my childhood, I have loved helping people. Besides, I like to keep my body in good shape, so I decided to compose these two things into one. Now, I'm happy and passionate about my job because each day I have an opportunity to help someone be a better version of themselves.</p>
